Translations (module for Omeka S)
=================================

[Translations] is a module for [Omeka S] that allows users to add their own
translations of strings.

As of Omeka S 4.0, both modules and themes are capable of providing translations
on their own. However, this module may still be used to fill in missing
translations or make overrides.

In Omeka, the translations are managed with `.po` files in the directory `application/language/`
for the core and in  the directory `language/` of each enabled module. This
module works the same, but you can add any strings yourself in the directory `language/`
of this module, so they will be translated in Omeka.

The translations themselves can be created with a tool like [poedit], or [lokalize],
or any other compliant software or online service.

This is an upgrade of the [plugin Translations] for [Omeka Classic].


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename module folder `Translations`.

See general end user documentation for [installing a module].


Usage
-----

### Preparation of templates

Simply update the translations files in the directory `language/` of the
module: the main one `template.pot` and each translation like `fr.po` and `fr.mo`.
You can add any language, but respect the names of the files (see `application/language/`)
and copy the two files `.po` and `.mo` for each language.

Quick hack to create the base `template.pot` file automatically:

- copy your theme inside the directory `modules`;
- then run this command from the Omeka root (some packages like `xgettext` should
  be installed first: see Omeka documentation):
```sh
# Create main template.
gulp i18n:module:template --module-name=my-theme

# If your editor can’t compile .po files, you can run this command after translating:
gulp i18n:module:compile --module-name=my-theme
```
- then copy all the files inside `language` into the directory `language` of
  this module;
- finally, remove the theme from the directory `modules`.

Warning: this process overrides existing templates, so save them first.

### Activation

In some cases, a cache may be used. In that case, restart the web server or
simply remove all files starting with `omeka_i18n_cache` in the temp directory
of the web server, usually `/tmp`, or `/tmp/systemd-private-xxx/tmp`. Or wait
some hours for the automatic refresh of the translations.

Anyway, when the translations are updated, you should uninstall and reinstall
the plugin in the config panel of Omeka. The translations will be automatically
available.

### Use of translations

Of course, all strings should be called via the controller plugin or the view
helper `translate`:
```php
// Example in a view (phtml file).
echo $this->translate('my text');

// Or for better performance:
$translate = $this->plugin('translate');
echo $translate('my text');
```


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.
